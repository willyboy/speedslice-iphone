                        <p class="question">I got a Message that told me my Order Wasn’t Confirmed, What’s up with that?</p>
                        <p>Sometimes in the restaurant industry things go unexpectedly wrong: you have to close early for the day or you are so swamped you can’t take orders. Or a giant pizza monster devours your delivery car.  Really, it could be anything.</p>
                        <p>When a restaurant doesn’t confirm the order that we sent over within 10 minutes, we tell you, and cancel the order.  If your order wasn’t confirmed, you won’t be charged for that pizza.  You may see a pending charge on your credit card, but it won’t be charged.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to place another order, as usual - we want you to get that pizza!</p>
